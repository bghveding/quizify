Quzifiy
=======
Quizify is a music quiz that uses the Spotify App API(https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/).

Quizify is my first attempt at 

* Using the Spotify App API
* Using Backbone.js
* Using Require.js
* Creating a single-page web app.

The above is basically my excuses for any short-comings :P

The app is nowhere near being finalized, but version control is needed, and github is awesome.
