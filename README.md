Quizify
=======
Quizify is a music quiz app that uses the Spotify App API(https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/).

Quizify is my first attempt at 

* Using the Spotify App API-ish
* Using Backbone.js
* Using Require.js
* Creating a single-page web app.

The above is basically my excuse for any short-comings :P

The app is nowhere near being finalized, but version control is needed and github is awesome.

# Usage

You need a Spotify developer account to use the app. Enable it at https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/#developer-account.

Depending on your OS, place the app in:

* ~/Spotify (Mac OS X)
* "My Documents\Spotify" (Windows)

Type "spotify:app:quizify" in search when in the Spotify client.
